0fSLAX - Small Live Linux CD07                             09F807

SLAX is a small live Linux CD that you can play around Linux with CD only and
it's not necessary to install it on your hard disk. SLAX is based on the 
Slackware Linux distribution and uses Unification File System.

It's handy that you can boot with SLAX and debug a corrupt Linux system not
just play around it. SLAX also has the option to install it into H.D.D if you
like it eventually.
